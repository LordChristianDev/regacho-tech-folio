                  <p>
                    I'm a versatile developer with a strong foundation in Flutter, PHP, and React, backed by a solid eye for UI/UX design. I build clean, scalable, and intuitive applications that not only work greatâ€”but feel great to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With hands-on experience conducting product demos in 10+ health facilities, including 3 Level 1 and 1 Level 2 hospitals, I understand how to present complex systems in user-friendly ways. I combine my technical expertise with a people-first mindset, making me equally comfortable in front of stakeholders as I am in front of code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I specialize in end-to-end analytics integrationâ€”from Firebase to PostHog to New Relicâ€”and use Sentry for proactive error tracking and performance monitoring. I'm comfortable working independently, managing my own roadmap, and delivering polished features that meet real user needs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Driven, reliable, and ready to make an impactâ€”I'm here to ship great products and deliver excellence every step of the way.
                  </p>
